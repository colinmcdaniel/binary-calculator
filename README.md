# Binary Calculator

* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/colinmcdaniel/binary-calculator)

## Functionality

This program prompts the user to input integers and subsequently converts them to binary code. Then the user is prompted to input their own binary code and the program outputs its equivalent integer value. The program stores this information in 'sign and magnitude' form in a BinaryInteger class, performs various bit-wise and shift operations (bit-wise addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and negation), and outputs it to the screen. Storing integers in a BinaryInteger class allows for much larger numbers to be stored than in an integer type variable.

This program utilizes operator overloading, friend functions, and pointers.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Either simply run the Unix executable file, or compile the source code yourself and run.
