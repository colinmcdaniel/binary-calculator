# Binary Calculator

* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/colinmcdaniel/binary-calculator)

## Functionality

This program prompts the user to input integers and subsequently converts them to binary code. Then the user is prompted to input their own binary code and the program outputs its equivalent integer value. The program stores this information in a BinaryInteger class, performs various bit-wise operations, and outputs it to the screen.

Doing it this way, numbers can be stored much larger than what is normally defined in a regular integer type.

Bit-wise addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and negation operations.

The BinaryInteger class stores integers in the 'sign and magnitude' form.

This program utilizes operator overloading, friend functions

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Either simply run the Unix executable file, or compile the source code yourself and run.
